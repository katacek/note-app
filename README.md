## My Notes app

Next.js app developed based following instructions:

> From [this list](https://codewithhugo.com/coding-web-app-ideas/#notes-app), build the first application - Notes app

> Main goal is to create a Next application and in it a single page that uses local storage to store notes locally in browser.
Use latest nextjs :)

1. Goal 1: Make it work with local storage ✔️
2. Goal 2: Make it look nice
3. Goal 3: Make the code look nice
4. Goal 4: Use IndexDB instead of local storage ✔️

The first commit is working version with local storage, then commented out and made it with IndexedBD.
